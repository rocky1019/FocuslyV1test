    <h2>What is Focusly?</h2>
    <p>
      Focusly is a real-time study web app that helps students stay focused, collaborate with peers, and make learning more fun and productive. With shared study rooms, live chat, Pomodoro timers, and a powerful whiteboard — Focusly creates the ultimate digital library experience.

    <h2>Why we built this</h2>
    <p>
      Most students struggle with procrastination and distractions while studying alone. Focusly was created to make studying feel less lonely and more interactive — so you can work together, track your progress, and build strong study habits in a shared space.
